This repository contains Matlab code for the paper, Robust Learning under Uncertain Test Distributions: Relating Covariate Shift to Model Misspecification. It also contains some code from other authors for comparison, as described in the paper. Please see the code for more details. The script ¡°testbed_release.m¡± is a simple demo.

Note:
- Our implementation depends on a pbm solver (Matlab mex file), which we only tested under 32/64-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux.
- The code works with Matlab R2013a. There may be some problems if you use other versions. Specifically, the quadprog function may have different interfaces.
